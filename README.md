# Predicting Future Traffic Hotspots Around the Shannon River

## Background Context
As small towns along the River Shannon continue to grow, new housing developments are springing up across the Irish Midlands. While these projects bring much-needed housing and vitality, the surrounding infrastructure, particularly local roads, often struggles to keep pace. Congestion in areas not designed for heavy traffic impacts residents’ quality of life, increases emissions, and slows down regional economic growth.

Understanding and predicting where future traffic congestion may occur can help local authorities, planners, and developers take proactive measures before bottlenecks form.

## Problem Framing
**Guiding Question:**  
How might we use data on new housing developments, population growth, and existing road networks to predict future traffic hotspots in small towns along the Shannon?

---

## Expected Outcomes
Examples (not prescriptions):
- A predictive model or map identifying likely congestion zones based on planned or ongoing residential construction.
- Visualizations that combine open traffic data, housing development data, and local infrastructure.
- A dashboard or decision-support tool for local councils and transport authorities.
- Policy recommendations for smarter transport or urban planning in the Shannon region.

---

## Difficulty
**Intermediate**  
Participants should have basic familiarity with data analysis, geospatial tools (e.g., QGIS, GeoPandas), and/or machine learning for prediction.

---

## Scope
**Included:**
- Analysis of publicly available data (e.g., planning permissions, OpenStreetMap roads, CSO population data, traffic counters).
- Modeling or visualization of traffic and development trends.
- Focus on towns and settlements along the Shannon River and nearby catchment area.

**Excluded:**
- Collection of new proprietary data or live sensor deployment.
- Modeling beyond a 5–10 year forecast horizon.
- Large-scale transport simulation requiring proprietary software.
